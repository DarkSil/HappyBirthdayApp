Happy Birthday App
Nanit's test task
  
<img src="https://github.com/DarkSil/HappyBirthdayApp/blob/master/files/demo.jpg" width="150"/>

Tech stack:

1. Architecture - MVVM
2. UI - Jetpack Compose
3. Navigation - Navigation Compose - I chose it due to Jetpack Compose best practices. 
    I can use Navigation Component with fragments instead but it will require a use of ComposeView which is 
    unnecessary in a "no-xml" project.
4. Data storage - Preferences DataStore - I decided not to move forward with Proto DataStore since 
    it's huge and way too complicated for that task.

Additionally I'd like to highlight reused resources in this project - I used SVG, color tint and other
  composables to create shapes required by design.

And at the end I should admit the ComposeView took a place in a project anyway - I needed it to easily create a screenshot :(
