Happy Birthday App
Nanit's test task

Tech stack:

Architecture - MVVM
UI - Jetpack Compose
Navigation - Navigation Compose - I chose it due to Jetpack Compose best practices. I can use Navigation Component with fragments instead but it will require a use of ComposeView which is unnecessary in a "no-xml" project
Data storage - Preferences DataStore - I decided not to move forward with Proto DataStore since it's huge and way too complicated for that task
